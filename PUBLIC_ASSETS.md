 # Public assets (logo & timeline images)

 Place the logo and timeline images for the site under the project's `public/` folder so Next.js can serve them directly.

 Recommended filenames (used by the components):

- `public/logo.png`  (export the best logo page from `Logo MNSS.pdf` as PNG at ~200â€“600px width)
- `public/assets/timeline-2009.jpg`
- `public/assets/timeline-2014-17.jpg`
- `public/assets/timeline-2022-23.jpg`
- `public/assets/timeline-2024-25.jpg`

 Quick instructions to extract images from the provided PDFs:

- On Windows: open the PDF in Adobe Acrobat Reader or Edge, go to the page with the desired image, use "Export" or "Save as Image" (PNG/JPG). Alternatively, take a high-resolution screenshot and crop it.
- On macOS: open the PDF in Preview, select the area and export as PNG/JPG.

 Place the exported images in `public/assets/` and ensure filenames match the list above. After adding images, restart the dev server (if running) and refresh the page.

 If you want, I can extract the best images from `Logo MNSS.pdf` and the progress reports if you authorize me to access those files here; otherwise please upload the exported images and I will wire them in for you.
