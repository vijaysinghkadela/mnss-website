// TODO -

1. Connect to the database to upload photos and videos, and record payments. (Media upload & basic payments API implemented.)
2. An admin dashboard plan that only uses NGOs. (Middleware added to restrict /dashboard to ngo_admin role.)
3. Begin online donations using UPI platform, net banking, and other services. (Donation intent + UPI link implemented; gateway integration pending.)
4. NEXT: Integrate real payment gateway (Razorpay/Cashfree) for net banking/cards & webhook verification.
5. Add QR code rendering for UPI link & donation success polling.
6. Secure payments/donations endpoints with auth or server-side key.
